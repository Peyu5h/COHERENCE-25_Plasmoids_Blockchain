# AuthSwap: Decentralized Identification System

## Overview
AuthSwap is a decentralized digital identity system that leverages **blockchain, self-sovereign identity (SSI), and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP)** to provide secure, privacy-preserving identity verification. It empowers users to **control their identity and credentials** without relying on centralized authorities.

## Features
- **Decentralized Identity (DID):** Users manage their identity without central authorities.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP):** Privacy-preserving verifications without exposing personal data.
- **Blockchain-based Credential Issuance:** Secure and immutable identity management.
- **IPFS Storage:** Encrypted storage of identity data off-chain.
- **MetaMask Integration:** Secure authentication and transactions.
- **QR Code & Biometric Unlock:** User-friendly authentication mechanisms.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet)
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
- **Privacy:** Circom/Zokrates (ZKPs)
- **Storage:** IPFS (Pinata)
- **Frontend:** React + Ethers.js , Wagmi
- **Authentication:** MetaMask, Biometric

## Abstract
AuthSwap is a decentralized digital identity system that leverages blockchain, self-sovereign identity (SSI), and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to provide secure, private, and user-controlled identity verification. It eliminates reliance on centralized authorities, ensuring data privacy and security. Users can store encrypted credentials on IPFS, authenticate via MetaMask, and verify identity using ZKPs without exposing sensitive information. With smart contracts and biometric authentication, AuthSwap offers a trustless, transparent, and efficient identity management solution for Web3 applications.
